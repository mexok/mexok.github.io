    <h1>Our philosophy</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Client comes first mentality</h2>
    <p>
    As a developer our main responsibility is to develop software which fulfills client's needs. Therefore, we need to
    put our egos in check to provide value for our clients. Also, as good software engineers, we recognize that
    requirements are subject to change and therefore, we must produce code in good quality which is maintainable and
    extensible. So we cannot be satisfied if the customer is happy, but have to walk the extra mile to do good and bring
    professionalism to our profession.
